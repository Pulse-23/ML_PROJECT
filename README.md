# Biomedical Waste Ash ML Project

This project explores the use of biomedical waste ash (BWA) in concrete mixes.  
Machine learning models such as Ensemble, Tabnet, Random Forest and SAINT were trained to predict compressive strength, tensile strength, and flexural strength based on the mix design.  

The goal is to evaluate how BWA content affects the mechanical performance of concrete  
and provide predictive insights for sustainable construction.
